			Locale-Codes Distribution
				v1.05

This distribution contains three modules which can be used to process
ISO two etter codes for identifying language and country, and
the three letter codes for identifying currencies and funds.

    Locale::Language
	Two letter codes for language identification (ISO 639).
	For example, 'en' is the code for 'English'.

    Locale::Country
	Two letter codes for country identification (ISO 3166).
	For example, 'bo' is the code for 'Bolivia'.

    Locale::Currency
	Three letter codes for currency and fund identification (ISO 4217).
	For example, 'sek' is the code for 'Swedish Krona'.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

The modules are documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get three man-pages: Locale::Language, Locale::Country,
and Locale::Currency.

The first version of Locale::Currency was written by Michael Hennecke,
with modifications for inclusion by me. Kudos to Michael.

Please let me know if you experience any problems with these modules,
or have any ideas for additions.
