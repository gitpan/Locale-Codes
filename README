			Locale-Codes Distribution
				v1.04

This distribution contains two modules which can be used to process
ISO two letter codes for identifying language and country.

    Locale::Language
	Two letter codes for language identification (ISO 639).
	For example, 'en' is the code for 'English'.

    Locale::Country
	Two letter codes for country identification (ISO 3166).
	For example, 'bo' is the code for 'Bolivia'.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

Both modules are documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get two man-pages: Locale::Language and Locale::Country.

Please let me know if you experience any problems with these modules,
or have any ideas for additions.
